**Adjustment Guidelines:**
- X-axis: Increase to move RIGHT, decrease to move LEFT

- Large adjustments: ¬±15+ pixels

### Step 5: Click Individual Fields for Details
- Click any red field overlay
- A popup appears showing:
  - Field name

  - Field size (width x height)
- Use this to verify exact coordinates

## üìù How to Record Adjustments

If you need to adjust positions, record them like this:

```json
{
  "field_name": {
    "old_position": {"x": 35, "y": 30},
    "new_position": {"x": 37, "y": 32},
    "reason": "Field was 2px too far left and 2px too high"
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Testing After Adjustments

After making position adjustments:
1. Update `data/t_fl100_gc120_positions.json`
2. Refresh the browser (F5)
3. Verify the new positions
4. Generate a test PDF to confirm:
   ```bash
   php test_field_alignment.php
   ```
5. Open the generated PDF and verify field positions match the form

## üì∏ Taking Screenshots for Documentation

You can take screenshots manually:
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Click "Toggle device toolbar" (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Set viewport to 794x1123 (A4 size)
4. Right-click the form container
5. Select "Capture node screenshot"

## üéØ Expected Results

When properly aligned, you should see:
- Red overlays perfectly centered on form field lines
- Checkboxes centered on form checkboxes
- Text field widths matching form field widths
- No overlapping between adjacent fields
- Fields staying within form boundaries

## üí° Tips

1. **Use the grid**: The 20px grid helps see alignment patterns
2. **Check one section at a time**: Use section filters to focus
3. **Toggle field visibility**: Hide/show overlays to see form clearly
4. **Compare with generated PDFs**: The ultimate test is the actual PDF output
5. **Start with obvious misalignments**: Fix large issues first, then fine-tune

## üöÄ Next Steps After Verification

Once all fields are verified and adjusted:
1. Export the final positions (click "Export Positions")
2. Save as `data/t_fl100_gc120_positions_verified.json`
3. Replace the original positions file if needed
4. Generate test PDFs to confirm
5. Document any changes made
6. Update the field fillers if positions changed significantly
