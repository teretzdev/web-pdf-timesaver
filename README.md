## File Structure

```
Web-PDFTimeSaver/
├── index.php                 # Root entry (redirects to mvp/index.php)
├── mvp/                      # New MVP app (projects, project, populate)
├── legacy/                   # Old scripts moved here
├── tests/                    # Test suite (run_all.php)
├── uploads/                # Directory for uploaded PDFs
├── output/                 # Directory for filled PDFs
├── .htaccess              # Apache configuration
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying the following files:

- `.htaccess`: Server configuration and security settings
- `simple_pdf_processor.php`: PDF processing settings and form field definitions

## Security Notes

- Uploaded files are validated for type and size
- File names are sanitized to prevent directory traversal
- Sensitive configuration files are protected from direct access
- Session-based file management prevents unauthorized access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload fails**: Check file size (max 10MB) and file type (PDF only)
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure `uploads/` and `output/` directories are writable
3. **PDF not displaying**: Check if the PDF file is valid and not corrupted
4. **Download not working**: Verify that the filled PDF was created successfully

### Error Messages

- "Only PDF files are allowed": Upload a valid PDF file
- "File size must be less than 10MB": Reduce the file size or compress the PDF
- "Failed to upload file": Check directory permissions
- "No PDF file in session": Upload a PDF file first before trying to fill it

## Development

This application uses a simplified PDF processing approach for demonstration purposes. For production use with actual PDF form filling, consider integrating with libraries like:

- FPDI (setasign/fpdi)
- TCPDF
- mPDF
- DomPDF
