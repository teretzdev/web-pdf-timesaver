### 🚀 Running the Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
# If PHP is installed locally:
php tests/run_all.php

# For Windows with XAMPP:
C:\xampp\php\php.exe tests\run_all.php

# Run individual test suites:
php tests/test_panel_management.php
php tests/test_template_editing.php
php tests/test_field_editor_comprehensive.php
php tests/test_form_population.php
```

### ✅ Test Results Expectations

When all tests pass, you should see:
- ✅ All panel management tests passed
- ✅ All template editing tests passed
- ✅ All field editor tests passed
- ✅ All form population tests passed

### 📝 Notes

1. **Test Data**: Tests use `data/mvp_test.json` to avoid affecting production data
2. **Cleanup**: All tests clean up their test data after completion
3. **Isolation**: Each test suite can run independently
4. **Validation**: Tests validate both structure and functionality

### 🔍 What's Being Tested

The test suite ensures that:
1. The panel system organizes fields exactly like Clio Draft
2. Templates support all the same field types and properties
3. The field editor provides visual positioning capabilities
4. Form data is validated and persisted correctly
5. The system supports custom fields and extensions

This comprehensive test coverage ensures that our codebase provides the same panel editing functionality as Clio Draft's panel editor, with proper organization, validation, and persistence of form data.
