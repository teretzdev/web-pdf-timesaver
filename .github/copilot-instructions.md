MCP server references and SDKs

This project includes a lightweight TypeScript MCP (stdio) server in `mcp-server/` for local testing with VS Code.

Suggested SDK/docs: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol and https://modelcontextprotocol.io/

Configure `.vscode/mcp.json` to point at the built `dist/server.js` and use the `mcp-windows-stdio` server entry.
